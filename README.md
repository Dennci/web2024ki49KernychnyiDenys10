## Project details
Our straightforward site is tailored for users to create and view their own posts exclusively. Upon logging in, individuals gain access to a personalized space where they can compose, edit, and view their posts. This simplicity ensures that users have a private area to manage and reflect on their content without the clutter of other users' posts. The design prioritizes user privacy and a seamless experience for creating and reviewing individual posts.

## Project Overview
Our project is built on a contemporary web development stack that includes PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The primary objective is to provide users with a seamless experience, emphasizing scalability, security, and maintainability.

### PHP (The MVP of the Backend)
PHP serves as the core of our backend infrastructure. Despite its long-standing presence, PHP remains a robust choice, contributing to the stability and reliability of our application.

### JavaScript
JavaScript plays a pivotal role on both the frontend and as a companion to the backend. Integrated into our PHP codebase, JavaScript efficiently executes tasks, enhancing user interactions with precision.

### HTML and CSS
The frontend presentation relies on the foundational elements of HTML and CSS. Our web pages are meticulously crafted with a focus on simplicity and elegance to ensure an immersive user experience.

### MySQL
Data management is entrusted to MySQL, known for its reliability and adherence to relational integrity and ACID compliance. While newer database technologies may offer scalability, the stability and familiarity of MySQL are valuable assets to our project.
